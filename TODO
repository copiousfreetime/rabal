== Things To Do and Things that are Done
=== You're Dropping the Ball Here.

* rabal should be a GemPluginManager
** figure out plugin namespaces '/tree/builtin/base' etc.
** move tree's to be in directories based on resource matching their namespace
** bootstrap builtin to be Gem even if not, this really is only for running in-scm
** use the GemPlugin::Manager for resource management too
* fix ERB errors, show better error
* subclass OptionParser to allow for plugins to hook into options
* command approach (new, add, ...)
* lint command
* License declaration or addition
* Hoe support
* SCM API Support for:
** Initialization, first setup
** Adding to and modification of the 'ignore' file (.boring, .cvsignore
svn:ignore, etc)
** Adding tree's to the project
** tagging the project with a release
** making sure nothing is left out of the project



=== Accomplishments!

* allow for insertion into project tree at an arbitrary path
* switch to Hash for children to allow for path access to data
* Tree namespaces
* cascade data access up the tree, method_missing
* Tree processing
** enter Tree
** do node thing
** process child Tree

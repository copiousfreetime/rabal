== DESCRIPTION

Rabal is the Ruby Architecture for Building Applications and Libraries.
Taking ideas from Haskell's Cabal, the Hoe and Rubyforge projects, rabal 
is a generalised project generation tool for initial creation of the
files and directories considered necessary in any ruby project.

== INSTALL

    gem install rabal

== FEATURES

Rabal uses the concept of a +plugin+.  A rabal +plugin+ defines a file and
directory template along with the necessary parameters used to generate
a final project directory tree.  

All files are run through ERB and portions of the file hierarchy are
replaced based upon the project name.

For example, the +core+ plugin that is the base main required plugin of
rabal is defined by the parameters +author+ and +email+ and the
following directory/file template:

   ./core/
   ./core/lib
   ./core/lib/rabal.project
   ./core/lib/rabal.project.rb.erb
   ./core/lib/rabal.project/version.rb.erb
   ./core/CHANGES
   ./core/INSTALL
   ./core/README
   ./core/Rakefile

From this template with 'example' as the project the following structure
was created:

    ./example/
    ./example/lib
    ./example/lib/example
    ./example/lib/example.rb
    ./example/lib/example/version.rb
    ./example/CHANGES
    ./example/INSTALL
    ./example/README
    ./example/Rakefile

Rabal currently ships with plugins for:

* core - core functionality and baseline information need by every  project
* license - indicate under what license your project is released.  Has
  templates for BSD, GPL, LGPL, MIT and Ruby License
* bin - command line application
* spec - an RSpec starting point
* test - a Test::Unit starting point

You are highly encouraged to write your own plugins and distribute them.
See the README.PLUGIN for information on how to develop your own.

== BUGS

Rabal is taking the release early and release often approach.  There
are guaranteed to be bugs.  In fact, there are some known options that
currently do nothing.  Please report all bugs in the {rubyforge bug
tracker}[http://rubyforge.org/tracker/?atid=14326&group_id=3707&func=browse]
